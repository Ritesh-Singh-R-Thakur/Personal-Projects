Watch",17 June 2024,"The watch is amazing and I liked it The watch really has a loud enough in built speaker that you can use to listen and talk on call. The mic also does a great job and the voice on the other side of the phone was clear as well. Battery life appears to be great as well.the appearance of the product. They mention it has a nice stylish display, good features, and good quality. The watch is valued for money. The touch screen is very good and also can track sleeping time."

Value for money and a nice gifting option",3 February 2023,"Bought this piece for a very peculiar reason. Needed a watch to remind my 8 year old daughter when to come back home after playing with friends. Initially bought the typical children's watch with an alarm (beep) for around 500 bucks. While the watch indeed had a good enough sound to alert, the process for setting the alarm was way too complicated to be handled either by her or her mother. Worse still, the alarm kept beeping unless it was disabled, once again following a labyrinthine process. So lost patience and decided to buy this one which is paired with my wife's mobile. Noise has done a great job providing a decent list of features at this price point. To be honest, I am a dumb user to talk about any of the smart features but comparing with similarly priced watches, it looks like a good buy. In my limited knowledge, here are the pros and cons:Pros:1. The screen has 60 hz refresh rate that really makes it very responsive and gorgeous.2. Some of the health related parameters like BPM, SpO2 appeared to be accurate when compared with an oximeter.3. The Noise mobile app impressed me with its slickness, smooth performance and a simple and intuitive user interface. The app does a fantastic job of synchronizing the settings almost realtime with the watch.4. Call functions on the watch are simple and easy to use. The watch really has a loud enough in-built speaker that you can use to listen and talk on call. The voice is perfectly audible with no noise and distortion. The mic also does a great job and the voice on the other side of the phone was clear as well. However, not sure how many people will find it useful to talk using their smart watch.5. Battery life appears to be great as well. Again, would like to clarify that the actual users of this watch are not power users so don't think I'll be doing justice with my feedback on this particular point but still.6. Wanted to buy the Rose Pink color but it was around 500 bucks more than most of the other colors so settled for Deep Wine. But surprisingly, this one looks gorgeous.Cons:No apparent cons but my biggest disappointment is the purpose for which I bought the watch remains unfulfilled. Not sure if that's the norm in watches at this price point but there is no sound either with the alarm or reminder. It only viabrates. So while playing, my daughter doesn't realize if the alarm is viabrating or not and misses it altogether. That's the reason for deducting one star. Really wish if Noise can fix it with a software update."

Best Smartwatch in this segment",10 June 2024,"I ordered Noise Colorfit Pro Max 5 and it got delivered the very next day at 8 AM. I have been using it for the last couple of days. I can definitely say this is the best investment you can make if you’re looking for a smartwatch at this price point. The statistics like Sleep, Blood Oxygen and Heart Rate are very accurate. Easy process to register for warranty. The NoiseFit App is one of the best companion apps that I have used, when compared to the previous ones I have used like Fitbit, Zepp. The charging is super fast and it charged my watch to 100% in close to 1.5 hours. The battery life is excellent if you’re using it for attending a few calls and track your exercises. The Elite Black metal version that I bought gives a premium appearence to the smartwatch. Overall, the build quality is excelllent. I will definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a watch in the below 5k price segment and would recommend to go for the Pro Max version over the Pro version for using those cool add-on features and a bigger display."

Below-par performance",22 May 2024,"I had ordered this watch (ColorFit Pro 5 Max 1.96"" AMOLED Display Smart Watch) and received it on the 4th of May and right off the bat I noticed certain issues with the watch.1) The performance of the watch is not very good. There is a lot of stutter and delay while swiping in any direction.2) The raise-to-wake feature is very inconsistent here. Sometimes it works as intended and sometimes you have to constantly keep raising it for it to work properly.3) I am not very satisfied with the battery backup of this watch. I have not connected my Bluetooth, I have turned off the Always-on display and overall there is no heavy usage involved but despite that, I can see that the battery drains quite drastically.Now, when I approached NOISE and explained the issues, it's safe to say that I was also not satisfied with their service. For one, they always take 2-3 days to contact you and when they do, they say they will connect you to their technical team but that never happens. Also, I should mention that my brother also got the same watch and even he is facing the above-mentioned issues. We even sent his watch to get it replaced and when we received the new one, there was no improvement at all and we were back to square one. For the price of this watch, we definitely expected a quality product but we feel that the previous model, Noise Colorfit Pro 4 alpha, is far superior to the Pro 5 Max model."

""ColorFit Pro 5 Max"": It's just the same as ""Colorfit Ultra 3"" which is 1500/- cheaper",12 June 2024,"Product is good. Nothing much to complain.However, when you compare ""ColorFit Pro 5 Max"" to ""Colorfit Ultra 3"", - Both have the exact same hardware specifications. - In terms of feature list, only thing that's additional in Pro 5 Max seems to be VO2-Max, which is a software peice. - Ultra 3 is around Rs. 1500/- cheaper than Pro 5 Max.So my recommendation would be to go with ""Colorfit Ultra 3"" instead of this one."

Smart fitness Smartwatch",23 April 2024,As its my first smartwatch and wanted to be pocket friendly this watch can be the latest one which suits within budget and has loads of benefits for this price range. Rather than directly buying an expensive one i would rather experiment with a budgeted watch to get used to such tech. This looks elegant and classy and best thing is it has amoled screen which gives rich colors. Extra battery life make life easy and not repetitive recharging in a day or 2. Inshort this you can go for it.

This is a good watch with big screen and unreliable sensor",2 January 2024,"This is a good looking all ""bells and whistles"" watch, more as a show-off factor than the real smart watch.  I checked the reading of heart rate monitor and SpO2 sensor using Pulse oximeter (Dr. Trust brand) and another tracker (Fit Bit Charge 5).My observations are as follows.Heart Rate monitoring : Slow to measure and within range of +/- 4 beats as compared to both fitbit and pulse oximeter device. Over all, this is better than having nothing to monitor. If some one wants better precision monitoring then use  Samsung, Garmin or Apple watch (wont reccomend Fitbit, it is very poor in quality, I purchased 4 trackers (charge 3, charge5 - 2 nos) / Smart watch(Versa v1) by Fitbit and 3 of them stopped working in less than 2 years).  While walking or running the heart rate sensor for ColorFit Pro 5 max goes for a toss.SpO2 sensor: Useless and massively inaccurate. When the other devices show the reading of 97, 98. This shows 86 or below. This inaccuracy is consistent accross multiple readings. Fun Fact: If the reading of Oxygen saturation is below 92%, this should ring alarm bell and will be counted as medical emergency. The same sensor is being used to calculate Stress levels and VO2 Max. Now guess how accurate they will be with such faulty sensors.Step counter: This is more precise of all the sensors but still approx 1-2% in variance (on higher side) as compared to Fitbit Charge 5.Software: This is still work in progress, hope the folks at noise will be taking the development of health related features with all the seriousness else they will soon lose the plot with other similar good for nothing smart watches flooding the market at even lower price points.Conclusion: Atleast the Noise folks have never claimed about the correctness of their sensors (they know it is all gimmickery, just like others in the similar price range). For end users, they have to decide why they want to go with this smart watch. If it is health data in their mind then run away from this or any similar watch in this or lower price category. As for me, I will start looking into Samsung smart watches. Unfortunately, only Fitbit comes up with no-nonsense trackers like Charge 6 (and unfortunately a very low quality one that does not last at all)."
